# AGENTS.md - AI Agent Instructions

## Project Overview

**The Great Analysis Challenge** is a polyglot chess engine implementation project. The goal is to implement the same chess engine specification across multiple programming languages to compare their approaches, paradigms, performance characteristics, and developer experiences.

## Project Goals

1. **Language Comparison**: Demonstrate how different programming languages approach the same problem
2. **Fair Benchmarking**: Provide consistent specifications so implementations can be fairly compared
3. **Educational Value**: Showcase language-specific features and paradigms
4. **Performance Analysis**: Compare compilation times, execution speed, and resource usage
5. **Developer Experience**: Document development workflow, tooling, and debugging approaches

## Core Constraints

### Universal Requirements

1. **Specification Compliance**: All implementations MUST follow `CHESS_ENGINE_SPECS.md`
2. **Docker-First**: All builds and tests MUST run inside Docker containers (enforced by Makefile)
3. **Standardized I/O**: Command-line interface via stdin/stdout with defined protocol
4. **Consistent Testing**: Pass automated test suite defined in `test/test_suite.json`
5. **Performance Targets**: Meet specified benchmarks (perft, AI depth timing)

### Implementation Rules

- Each language gets its own directory: `<language>/`
- Required files per implementation:
  - `Dockerfile` - Complete build and runtime environment
  - `chess.meta` - JSON metadata about the implementation
  - `README.md` - Language-specific documentation
  - Main source files following language conventions
- No cross-language dependencies
- No modification of other language implementations without explicit approval
- Focus on idiomatic code for each language

## Workflow to Add a New Chess Implementation

### Phase 1: Setup (15-30 minutes)

1. **Create Language Directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir <language>
   cd <language>
   ```

2. **Create Dockerfile**
   - Base image for the language (official images preferred)
   - Install language runtime/compiler and dependencies
   - Copy source files to `/app`
   - Build/compile if needed
   - Set default command to run the chess engine
   - Keep image size reasonable (multi-stage builds recommended)

3. **Create chess.meta**
   ```json
   {
     "language": "<language_name>",
     "version": "<language_version>",
     "author": "Your Name",
     "build": "<build_command>",
     "run": "<run_command>",
     "features": ["perft", "fen", "ai", "castling", "en_passant", "promotion"],
     "max_ai_depth": 5,
     "estimated_perft4_ms": 1000
   }
   ```

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (2-8 hours)

4. **Implement Core Components** (in order of priority)
   
   a. **Board Representation** (30-60 min)
      - 8x8 board structure
      - Piece representation (K/Q/R/B/N/P and k/q/r/b/n/p)
      - Position state (whose turn, castling rights, en passant)
   
   b. **Move Generator** (60-120 min)
      - Generate all pseudo-legal moves for each piece type
      - Validate moves don't leave king in check
      - Special moves: castling, en passant, promotion
   
   c. **FEN Parser** (30-45 min)
      - Parse FEN string to board state
      - Serialize board state to FEN string
      - Test with standard positions from `CHESS_ENGINE_SPECS.md`
   
   d. **Game State Manager** (45-90 min)
      - Execute/undo moves
      - Track game history
      - Detect checkmate, stalemate
      - Handle turn order
   
   e. **Command Interface** (30-45 min)
      - Read commands from stdin
      - Parse and dispatch commands
      - Display board in ASCII format (with coordinates)
      - Output status messages in spec format
   
   f. **AI Engine** (90-180 min)
      - Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
      - Position evaluation function (material + positional bonuses)
      - Depth-limited search (1-5 ply)
      - Move ordering for better pruning

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (1-2 hours)

5. **Test Locally with Docker**
   ```bash
   # Build image
   docker build -t chess-<language> .
   
   # Basic test
   echo -e "new\nmove e2e4\nmove e7e5\nexport\nquit" | docker run -i chess-<language>
   
   # AI test
   echo -e "new\nai 3\nquit" | docker run -i chess-<language>
   
   # Perft test
   echo -e "new\nperft 4\nquit" | docker run -i chess-<language>
   ```

6. **Verify Test Suite Compliance**
   - Run automated tests: `make test-<language>`
   - Check all test categories pass (basic, special_moves, game_end, ai, fen)
   - Validate perft(4) returns 197281
   - Ensure AI makes legal moves at all depths

7. **Performance Validation**
   - Measure compilation time
   - Check AI depth 3 < 2 seconds
   - Check AI depth 5 < 10 seconds
   - Verify perft(4) < 1 second (optional, nice to have)

### Phase 4: Documentation (30-45 minutes)

8. **Write README.md**
   - Overview of implementation
   - Language features showcased
   - Build and run instructions
   - Performance characteristics
   - Dependencies
   - Development workflow
   - Example usage

9. **Add to Main README**
   - Add language section to root `README.md`
   - Include paradigm description
   - Note key features
   - Add build command and timing
   - Update language list

10. **Update Makefile** (if not already present)
    - Add `test-<language>` target
    - Add `build-<language>` target
    - Add to `LANGUAGES` list
    - Follow existing patterns

### Phase 5: Integration (15-30 minutes)

11. **CI/CD Integration** (optional but recommended)
    - Workflow files in `.github/workflows/` should auto-detect
    - Verify build runs in CI
    - Check test results

12. **Final Validation**
    - Clean build: `docker rmi chess-<language>; make build-<language>`
    - Full test: `make test-<language>`
    - Check output format matches spec
    - Verify error handling

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Chess Logic Errors
- **Castling**: Verify ALL conditions (no prior moves, no pieces between, king not in/through check)
- **En Passant**: Only valid immediately after opponent's two-square pawn move
- **Promotion**: Handle auto-promotion to Queen if not specified
- **Check Detection**: Must prevent moves that leave own king in check
- **Coordinates**: a1 is bottom-left for White (row 0/7 depending on indexing)

### Implementation Issues
- **Input Buffering**: Flush stdout after each output (critical for stdin/stdout protocol)
- **FEN Parsing**: Handle all 6 FEN fields correctly (especially castling rights and en passant)
- **Move Notation**: Use algebraic notation (e2e4, not e4 or Nf3)
- **Error Recovery**: Invalid commands should not crash the program
- **Case Sensitivity**: White pieces uppercase, black lowercase

### Docker/Testing Issues
- **Working Directory**: Ensure commands run in correct directory (`/app`)
- **Executable Permissions**: Make scripts executable in Dockerfile
- **Build Artifacts**: Don't commit build artifacts (use .dockerignore)
- **Dependencies**: Lock dependency versions for reproducibility
- **Image Size**: Use multi-stage builds to reduce final image size

## Development Best Practices

### Language-Specific Showcases

When implementing, demonstrate the language's unique strengths:

- **Systems Languages (Rust, C++, Zig)**: Memory management, zero-cost abstractions, bitboards
- **Functional Languages (Haskell, Gleam, Elm)**: Immutable state, pure functions, type safety
- **OOP Languages (Java, Kotlin, C#)**: Design patterns, interfaces, polymorphism
- **Dynamic Languages (Python, Ruby, JavaScript)**: Rapid prototyping, metaprogramming, expressiveness
- **Concurrent Languages (Go, Erlang)**: Goroutines/actors, parallel search

### Code Quality

- Write idiomatic code for the language
- Add comments for complex chess logic only
- Use language's standard formatting tools
- Include static analysis where available
- Keep functions focused and testable
- Document public APIs

### Performance Optimization

- Use appropriate data structures (arrays for boards, bitboards if suitable)
- Implement move ordering for alpha-beta pruning
- Cache evaluation results if possible
- Profile before optimizing
- Balance readability vs performance

## Testing Strategy

### Required Tests (Automated)

All implementations must pass tests in `test/test_suite.json`:

1. **Basic Movement**: Standard piece moves and captures
2. **Special Moves**: Castling, en passant, promotion
3. **Game End**: Checkmate and stalemate detection
4. **AI**: Legal move generation at all depths
5. **FEN**: Import/export position accuracy

### Manual Testing

Test interactively:
```bash
docker run -it chess-<language>

# In the chess engine:
> help
> new
> move e2e4
> move e7e5
> ai 3
> export
> quit
```

### Performance Testing

```bash
# Compilation time
time make build-<language>

# Perft benchmark
echo -e "new\nperft 4\nquit" | time docker run -i chess-<language>

# AI performance
echo -e "new\nai 5\nquit" | time docker run -i chess-<language>
```

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to implement all features?**  
A: Yes, for compliance. But you can start with basic compliance and add optimizations later.

**Q: Can I use chess libraries?**  
A: No. The goal is to implement the logic to compare languages, not libraries.

**Q: What if my language is very slow?**  
A: Performance targets are guidelines. Focus on correctness first, then optimize within reason.

**Q: Can I use different algorithms than minimax?**  
A: No. The specification requires minimax with alpha-beta for fair comparison.

**Q: How important is code quality?**  
A: Very. The code should be readable and idiomatic to showcase the language properly.

**Q: Can I modify the test suite?**  
A: No. Tests are standardized for fair comparison across languages.

**Q: What about languages without mature Docker support?**  
A: All major languages have official Docker images. For experimental languages, create a working Dockerfile or skip that language.

**Q: Should I optimize for speed or readability?**  
A: Balance both. Prioritize idiomatic, readable code, then optimize hot paths if needed.
