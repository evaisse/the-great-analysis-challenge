# The Great Analysis Challenge

> Polyglot chess engine benchmark comparing languages under a single spec with Docker-first builds, standardized CLI, and automated tests.

This repository hosts parallel chess engines implemented per-language to compare paradigms, performance, and developer experience. Every implementation must:
- Follow `CHESS_ENGINE_SPECS.md` for board state, CLI protocol, AI search (minimax + alpha-beta), and perft targets
- Ship its own `Dockerfile`, `chess.meta`, and README under `implementations/<language>/`
- Build, run, and test exclusively through the Docker targets defined in the root `Makefile` and the shared test harness in `test/`
- **Ensure `Dockerfile` has NO external downloads** (binaries/toolchains) except via standard language package managers; use base images with full toolchains instead.

## Core Specs

- [CHESS_ENGINE_SPECS.md](CHESS_ENGINE_SPECS.md): Authoritative rules for board representation, commands, AI depth limits, and performance benchmarks.
- [AI_ALGORITHM_SPEC.md](AI_ALGORITHM_SPEC.md): Detailed minimax + alpha-beta requirements and evaluation guidelines referenced by all languages.

## Implementation & Agent Guides

- [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md): Operational instructions and guardrails for AI agents contributing to the project.
- [README_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md](README_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md): Step-by-step workflow for building a compliant language implementation.
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md): Contribution process, coding standards, and review expectations.

## Project Overview & Status

- [README.md](README.md): High-level project overview, goals, and language matrix.
- [LANGUAGE_STATISTICS_README.md](LANGUAGE_STATISTICS_README.md): Explanation of the language metrics pipeline.
- [language_statistics.yaml](language_statistics.yaml): Current per-language statistics consumed by dashboards and reports.

## Build, Test, and Automation

- [Makefile](Makefile): Canonical Docker build/test targets (e.g., `make build-<lang>`, `make test-<lang>`).
- [test/test_suite.json](test/test_suite.json): Declarative test definitions covering movement, special rules, AI, and FEN requirements.
- [test/test_harness.py](test/test_harness.py): Runner invoked by the Make targets and CI workflows.
- [.github/workflows/bench.yaml](.github/workflows/bench.yaml): CI entry point for benchmarking and regression checks.
- [.github/workflows/test.yaml](.github/workflows/test.yaml): CI pipeline executing the shared test harness across implementations.

## Implementation References

- [implementations/](implementations): Production-ready language directories, each containing its Dockerfile, `chess.meta`, README, and source.
- [implementations-wip/](implementations-wip): Experimental or in-progress language ports awaiting graduation to `implementations/`.
- [docs/](docs): Additional language-specific or architectural notes referenced by some implementations.

## Verification & Reporting

- [verification_results.txt](verification_results.txt): Latest summarized verification run outcomes.
- [build_results.log](build_results.log): Historical build logs useful for diagnosing CI or Docker regressions.
- [reports/](reports): Generated analysis artifacts and benchmarking summaries.

## Optional

- [scripts/](scripts): Helper utilities (stats refresh, doc builders, automation aides).
- [workflow](workflow): CLI helper for orchestrating multi-language workflows during local development.
- [build-local.sh](build-local.sh): Convenience wrapper for executing Docker builds outside the Make targets.
