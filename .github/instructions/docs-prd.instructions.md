# PRD Document Instructions

- PRDs describe features to complexify the codebase and stress toolchains
- Each PRD targets all 7 active languages: Rust, TypeScript, Python, PHP, Dart, Ruby, Lua
- PRDs MUST document: functional description, impact per language (what it stresses), files to create, tests, success criteria
- Follow the existing PRD format (see docs/prd/README.md for the overview and dependency graph)
- Priority levels: P1 (fort impact build), P2 (stress typé compile-time), P3 (bonus)
- Cross-reference the dependency graph when adding new PRDs
- Each PRD has a corresponding GitHub issue
