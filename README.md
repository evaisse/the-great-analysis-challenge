# The Great Analysis Challenge: Multi-Language Chess Engine Project

A comprehensive project implementing identical chess engines across **17 different programming languages** to compare their approaches, performance, and unique paradigms.

## 🏆 Project Achievement: 100% Feature Standardization Complete!

All 17 implementations have **EXCELLENT** status with complete feature parity:
- ✅ **perft** - Performance testing with recursive move generation
- ✅ **fen** - Forsyth-Edwards Notation support  
- ✅ **ai** - Artificial intelligence with minimax algorithms
- ✅ **castling** - Special king-rook moves
- ✅ **en_passant** - Special pawn capture rules
- ✅ **promotion** - Pawn advancement to other pieces

## 🐳 Docker-First Testing

All implementations are tested exclusively via Docker containers to ensure:
- **Consistent Environment**: No host toolchain dependencies
- **Reproducible Results**: Identical testing conditions
- **Simplified CI/CD**: Only Docker required, not 17+ language toolchains

```bash
cd implementations/<language>
docker build -t chess-<language> .
docker run -it chess-<language>
```

## 📋 Architecture

Each implementation follows identical specifications defined in [CHESS_ENGINE_SPECS.md](./CHESS_ENGINE_SPECS.md):
- **Standardized Commands**: Identical interface across all languages
- **Docker Support**: Containerized testing and deployment
- **Makefile Targets**: `build`, `test`, `analyze`, `docker-test`
- **Metadata**: Structured information in `chess.meta` files
