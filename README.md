This is a project that builds a sample chess engine in many different languages to implement the exact same application and compare their approaches.

# The Game

The game specs are defined in [./CHESS_ENGINE_SPECS.md](./CHESS_ENGINE_SPECS.md)

# Language Implementations

Each application is implemented in a different language, showcasing their unique strengths and paradigms:

## Available Languages

### ü¶Ä **Rust** (`./rust/`)
**Paradigm**: Systems programming with memory safety  
**Key Features**: Zero-cost abstractions, ownership system, pattern matching  
**Compile Command**: `cd rust && cargo build --release`  
**Build Time**: ~30-60 seconds (first build), ~5-10 seconds (incremental)

### üêπ **Go** (`./go/`)  
**Paradigm**: Simple, concurrent, compiled  
**Key Features**: Goroutines, channels, fast compilation  
**Compile Command**: `cd go && go build ./cmd/chess`  
**Build Time**: ~2-5 seconds

### üéØ **Dart** (`./dart/`)
**Paradigm**: Object-oriented, null-safe  
**Key Features**: Strong typing, async/await, Flutter ecosystem  
**Compile Command**: `cd dart && dart compile exe bin/main.dart`  
**Build Time**: ~5-10 seconds

### üü¶ **TypeScript** (`./typescript/`)
**Paradigm**: JavaScript with static typing  
**Key Features**: Type safety, modern ES features, large ecosystem  
**Compile Command**: `cd typescript && npm run build`  
**Build Time**: ~10-15 seconds

### üî• **Gleam** (`./gleam/`)
**Paradigm**: Functional programming on the BEAM VM  
**Key Features**: Type safety, immutability, pattern matching, fault tolerance  
**Compile Command**: `cd gleam && gleam build`  
**Build Time**: ~5-10 seconds

### üèóÔ∏è **Kotlin** (`./kotlin/`)
**Paradigm**: Modern JVM language combining OOP and functional  
**Key Features**: Null safety, data classes, coroutines, Java interop  
**Compile Command**: `cd kotlin && ./gradlew build`  
**Build Time**: ~15-30 seconds (first build), ~5-10 seconds (incremental)

## Compilation Speed Comparison

To benchmark compilation speeds across all implementations:

```bash
# Rust (systems programming)
time (cd rust && cargo build --release)

# Go (fast compilation focus)  
time (cd go && go build ./cmd/chess)

# Dart (compiled native executables)
time (cd dart && dart compile exe bin/main.dart)

# TypeScript (transpiled to JavaScript)
time (cd typescript && npm run build)

# Gleam (functional on BEAM VM)
time (cd gleam && gleam build)

# Kotlin (JVM compilation)
time (cd kotlin && ./gradlew build --no-daemon)
```

## Docker Build & Run

Each implementation includes Docker support for consistent builds:

```bash
# Build and run any implementation
cd <language-directory>
docker build -t chess-<language> .
docker run -it chess-<language>
```

## Performance Notes

- **Go**: Fastest compilation, designed for rapid development cycles
- **Dart**: Fast compilation with native code generation  
- **Gleam**: Quick builds with excellent error messages
- **TypeScript**: Moderate speed, depends on project size and dependencies
- **Kotlin**: Moderate speed, benefits from Gradle's incremental compilation
- **Rust**: Slowest compilation but produces highly optimized binaries

For each folder, you get a Dockerfile that allows you to analyze and build these projects from scratch without struggling with dependencies.
